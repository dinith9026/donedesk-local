          <h5>Social Media Searches </h5>
          <p>This report involves a combination of technology and human expert analytics to correctly identify a subject's online presence on the websites where adverse content is most likely to be found: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Once a subject's profile is correctly identified, publicly available content is reviewed for business-related behaviors -racism/intolerance, violence, potentially illegal activity, and sexually explicit material. A report is then created with a summary of screenshot examples of adverse, actionable material. This helps protect the company's brand and reputation.</p>
